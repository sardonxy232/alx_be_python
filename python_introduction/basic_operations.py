# Create a file named basic_operations.py.
# In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
# You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
# Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
# Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].
# Expected Output:

# When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5):

# How to execute

# python3 basic_operations.py
# Here is the outcome

# Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
# Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
# Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
number1, number2 = 10, 5

x = number1 + number2
y = number1 - number2
z = number1 * number2
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {x}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {y}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {z}")
# The code above defines two variables, number2 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
# It then calculates the sum, difference, and product of these two numbers and prints the results in a formatted string.
